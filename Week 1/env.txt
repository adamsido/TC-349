J Edit

While testing a couple of text editors, J edit was the best option because it is very easy to code on the editor and all the functions are easy to use. Compared to other text editors I have used in the past, J edit does a very good job at making the coding easier and much more understanding. 

All the functions are on the top tab and they are simple to access and use to code. I really like the J Edit so far and in my opinion, it is the best compared to the other text editors I have used in the past.
