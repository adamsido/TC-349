Gojane.com

I chose to critique Gojane.com because this is one of my favorite shopping sites. I love shopping on my iphone because the mobile site is so organized and very easy to navigate. The sections are well layered and the width of the screen is just right on my iphone. 

Gojane.com did a good job with the way their mobile site is set up. Even when i twist my iphone around from potrait to landscape orientation, the screen of the site still fits right on my iphone. the navigation is great! plus the content of the site are all in the right spot and is very organized. This mobile site is very well done, and from my experience also shopping on the normal Gojane.com site on my computer, I can tell the difference and the mobile site is well built.
