MSU's Homepage

Msu's homepage is very organized, the html code shows it all, I just love the structure of it. The stylesheet and javascript are both linked externally. The site uses a lot of li functions, which are very well coded and structured. 

The thing about the homepage is the navigation,I love how you can browse through and navigate to other pages very well on this site. The html coding is very well done, I love the organization and it is very easy to read and understand. Very well done site.
