<h1> Foldable.Me </h1>

<p> Myself and a three other friends got togeher to perform this sorting. We all took out sticky notes and wrote words and phrases on different ones. Then after we wrote all the words that were relating to the site, we all used those sticky notes to create the sorting for the site. I sorted first and then my three other friends sorted. We all tried to sort the content of the site in ways very similar to the structure of the site and for it to still make sense. </p>

<h2> Sort 1 </h2>

<p> The first sort was done by me. Looking at the foldabe website, I chose to go in the same format as the site and sorted using a very similar structure. Although it does not look exactly the same, I wanted to sort the content and get it as close as i could to match the foldable site's structure and layout.  </p>

<h2> Sort 2 </h2>

<p>My first friend sorted this layout and he tried to go for something more simple but still in the same layout as the site. His and mine were quite similar and we did agree the most on things when all four of us were discussing the basics of the content of the site and how the sorting would look.</p>

<h2> Sort 3 </h2>

<p> My second friend did his sorting and it is obvious that we all were on the same page because his was kind of similar to mine and my first friend's sorting but we still all had our own different perspectives on what the content should look like. He was going for simple also but something more organized and in place. </p>

<h2> Sort 4 </h2>

<p> My third friend loved the structure of the site so much and she was very excited when sorting her sticky notes. She stared off by analyzing the shapes, images and content on the site before she sorted her cards, she used the discussion we all had in the beginning and her findings to create her own sorting and she turned out to create a great layout. We all took a look at all our sorting and decided her layout was the best and was kind of the closest to the same structure of the site.</p>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>
We are not all website geniuses but this was actually fun to do. It was fun examining a site espeially a simple nicely structured site like foldable.me. We analyzed the site content to our own understanding and created the index cards based on what we felt were the right words or phrases to use and how to sort out the sticky notes to recreate the site's structure. It was not as easy trying to figure it out but after discussing for a good amount of time, we figured it out and sorted the contents.</p>
