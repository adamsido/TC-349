<h1> Fillani vintage </h1>

<p> Fillani Vintage is a clothing line that I started in the summer of 2012. I love making handmade clothes and that is what the whole brand is about. I figured I can create a site for my clothing just for fun for my final project and it will make the project more interesting for me. I am focusing on the a similar design to my blog for my site. The site to my blog is http://fillanivintage.tumblr.com/ and that is just an example of the design I am going for in my final project, just something very similar. I like the columns and the use of space and just the structure of the design plus the image layout is just how I like it plus I just want to make the site fun and interesting to browse. </p> 

<h2> Sort 1 </h2>

<p> Myself and the same three friends worked on the sorting of this site also. We based the content and sorting off my tumblr page since that was the design I was going for. I did the first sorting and tried to keep it simple but still create enough columns in order for the image layout to be nice. I was going for a simple but also for the site to have enough content. I pretty much used my tumblr page as a guide and sorted out the sticky notes and created a new layout.</p> 

<h2> Sort 2 </h2>

<p> My first friend was thinking something more complicated since I wanted it to be a fun site with a lot of images of my clothing. He figured making instead of just simple columns, the images and content can be redisgned and placed in a different shape and that's how he came up with his own layout. </p>

<h2> Sort 3 </h2>

<p> My second friend tried to find a way the columns could be very different and not just simple columns. He looked at my blog, and designs and based of his layout figuring what items or images should be displayed on what part of the page. He visualized the images and content of my clothing plus what he saw on my blog and created his layout. </p>

<h2> Sort 4 </h2>

<p> My third friend analyzed my blog in different ways and tried to think of different ways the blog itself could be laid out and redesigned and then she used those thoughts to play around with the sticky notes and words but then ended up keeping it simple and creating the most simple layout out of us all based on what she imagined and how good she thought the site would be if it was a very simple structure but with nicely laid images. </p>

<h1> Conclusion </h1>

I am glad that I get to create a site for my clothing line even if it is not an official site but it just makes it more interesting to play around with the content and create something good. We all had a good time sorting the content for this one too and it was much more fun because now we got to use our ideas and create a layout for a completely new site but also with the aid of my blog. </p>
