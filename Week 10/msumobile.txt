MSU MOBILE SITE

I browsed through the site using my iphone and the mobile site is just so portable and adorable. Based on all the work we did for this week's assignment and learning these things, it made it easier for me to critique this site. I love the arrangement and set up of the site.It is very clear and easy to navigate on my phone. The content is well laid out as well as the buttons. 

I really love how simple the mobile site is compared to the normal website, I loved the setting and it seems like it has less content but I love navigating through the site on my phone, very well nicely done. This is a good example of a mobile site in my opinion and it is well nicely built and structured.
