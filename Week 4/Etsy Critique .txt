Etsy Critique 

     Etsy is displayed with nice colors and structure. The HTML source is not as neat and tidy but a little bit nicely structured. It has very good javascript included. The page source of the site includes many links, a lot of divisions (div), meta, link, script, ul, and is also created into different sections including the head and body all included in the page source. 

     The site's CSS style sheet and javascript are both included in a separate file and linked to the html file. There is a lot of in line scripting, I like how the site is separated into different chunks which also makes it easier to navigate and use. Very well done and built site.
