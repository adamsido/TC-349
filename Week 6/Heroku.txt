This page is nicely structured and organized. it uses a lot of link, li, div, section, article just similar to the styles we learned in this last lab. The css and javascript are linked externally, and the site uses different classes like class, widget, logo, content. It is very easy to navigate around this site, very simple formatted site, and nice solid colors. The lists are coded and done very nicely and well organized. 

The layouts I used for my personal website were all three. Based on the different pages and content, i incorporated all single, double and gallery layouts to all four pages. I just loved the difference in all the layouts and how each layout fit well with a certain page. I did not want to stick to just one layout for all pages but instead make use of those three I already liked from doing the lab in the videos and making them fit perfectly with the each page. I just love the setting and the layout structures all them all.
